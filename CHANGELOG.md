# Change Log

## 0.0.6 - First Release


## 0.0.4 - Add Snippets

Group all Symplex functionality underneath the `symplex.Evaluate` command.  Add snippets which document a few of the SymPy features that Symplex exposes. 


## 0.0.3 - Major Refactor

Allow writing of arbitrary SymPy operations, encapsulate adding support for new languages, and add LaTeX output!


## 0.0.2 - Python Support

Since `SymPy` operates natively in Python syntax, it was straight-forward to add basic Python support.


## 0.0.1 - Proof of Concept

Have proven that the typescript AST tree can be transformed into a `SymPy` compatible format, and that Python scripts can be invoked to perform arbitrary work for the editor at low-latencies.  The infrastructure is ready for massive expansion in capability, once the right UI affordances are found and the Javascript/Typescript parsing code is improved.
